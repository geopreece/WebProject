            I did my dissertation with a client and developed their patent for a multi-phase turbine. I designed a Tesla turbine optimised based on extensive literature survey. Due to the pandemic I couldnâ€™t test my turbine in the lab, but I did CFD simulations on Solidworks to see how the fluid would interact with the system.
