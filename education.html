            I completed a client supervised dissertation designing and developing the patent for a multi-phase Tesla turbine. It was extremely disappointing that pandemic restrictions prohibited lab testing of the turbine but CFD simulations on Solidworks allowed me to see how the fluid would interact with the system.

            The Tesla turbine is a mechanical turbine that is bladeless (unlike most current turbines). It doesn’t use the momentum of fluid to drive the shaft but relies upon viscous and adhesive fluid forces. The first design was patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913 in New York.

            In the Tesla turbine, the loss of velocity of the fluid when interacting with the disk means that energy is transferred in the form of rotation due to a boundary layer effect. Having an array of discs attached to a shaft can create torque and the resulting rotation can be used to generate electricity.

            The turbine has many advantages over conventional turbines. Since the disks are encased in an enclosure/chamber there are essentially no moving parts to the observer making them inerently safer. This is unlike bladed turbines where nothing other than intuition prevents a person or animal from travelling into the rotational path of the blades. Bird strikes, for example, on windmills and airplane engines are commonly reported.

            When a fluid flows along a plane, in this case the disks, adhesive forces causes a layer of the fluid to stick to the surface of the plane. Viscous forces within the fluid means “molecules just above the surface are slowed down in their collisions with the molecules sticking to the surface. These molecules in turn slow down the flow just above them. The farther one moves away from the surface, the fewer the collisions affected by the object surface. This creates a thin layer of fluid near the surface” (Hall, 2015). This is the boundary layer effect.
